Question 1
Consider the following Python function:

def root (a, b, c):
    discriminant = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
    return (-b - discriminant ** 0.5) / (2 * a)
    
- Quadratic Formula

Question 2
Which of the mathematical functions displayed below are linear?

- g(y) = 2y - 3
- h(z) = 3
- f(x) = x + 10

Question 3
Compute the logarithm base 5 of root 7.
- 3.5

Question 4
The significant figures of a number are those digits that carry meaning contributing to its precision. 
A digit is significant based on the three following rules:

1. All non-zero digits are considered significant.
2. Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant.
3. Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant.

How many significant digits does the decimal number 0.00400100 have?
- 6, The last two trailing zeroes are significant.

Question 5
The number aa is the mantissa while the integer bb is the exponent.  
The mantissa is usually expressed using the same number of significant digits as used in the original decimal form.
- a = 4.00100, The two trailing zero are significant in 0.00400100
