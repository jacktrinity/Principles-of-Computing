Question 1
Consider the following Python function:

def root (a, b, c):
    discriminant = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
    return (-b - discriminant ** 0.5) / (2 * a)
    
- Quadratic Formula

Question 2
Which of the mathematical functions displayed below are linear?

- g(y) = 2y - 3
- h(z) = 3
- f(x) = x + 10

Question 3
Compute the logarithm base 5 of root 7.
- 3.5

Question 4
The significant figures of a number are those digits that carry meaning contributing to its precision. 
A digit is significant based on the three following rules:

1. All non-zero digits are considered significant.
2. Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant.
3. Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant.

How many significant digits does the decimal number 0.00400100 have?
- 6, The last two trailing zeroes are significant.

Question 5
The number aa is the mantissa while the integer bb is the exponent.  
The mantissa is usually expressed using the same number of significant digits as used in the original decimal form.
- a = 4.00100, The two trailing zero are significant in 0.00400100

Question 6
For this question, look up (or compute) the decimal representation of the number π and enter the value of π with five significant digits of precision in the box below.  
Remember to round as describe above.
- 3.1416

Question 7
Grids
Consider the following code snippet:

row = ...
col = ...
nested_list = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]

print nested_list[row][col]

If running this code snippet prints 13 in the console, what are the non-negative values of row and col?
- 2 3

Question 8
Given a grid of size 4 X 6, what are the row and column indices for the upper right cell in this grid? 
Enter the row and columns indices below as numbers separated by a space.
- 0 5

Question 9
Given a 4 X 4 grid, what values for start_cell and direction would cause traverse_grid to traverse the diagonal of grid connecting the lower right tile to the upper left tile?
-
start_cell = (3, 3)
direction = (-1, -1)
