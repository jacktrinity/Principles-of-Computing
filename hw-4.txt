Week 4 of "Principles of Computing"

Question 1
Given the set of outcomes corresponding to a coin flip, {Heads,Tails}, how many sequences of outcomes of length five (repetition allowed) are possible?
- 32

Question 2
Consider a sequence of trials in which a fair four-sided die (with faces numbered 1-4) is rolled twice.  
What is the expected value of the product of the two die rolls? 
- 6.25

Question 3
Given a trial in which a decimal digit is selected from the list ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"] with equal probability 0.1, 
consider a five-digit string created by a sequence of such trials (leading zeros and repeated digits are allowed). 
What is the probability that this five-digit string consists of five consecutive digits in either ascending or descending order?
- 0.00012

Question 4
Consider a trial in which five digit strings are formed as permutations of the digits ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"] 
(In this case, repetition of digits is not allowed.) 
If the probability of each permutation is the same, what is the probability that this five digits string consists of consecutive digits in either ascending or descending order?
- 0.00039682539

Question 5
Implement a function gen_permutations(outcomes, num_trials) that takes a list of outcomes and a number of trials and returns a set of all possible permutations of length num_trials (encoded as tuples) from this set of outcomes.  
- ('b', 'e', 'c', 'd')

Question 6
A set S is a subset of another set T if every element x in S is also a member of T.
Which of the following sets are subsets of the set {1, 2}?
- {}
- {1, 2}
- {1}

Question 7
If the set T has n numbers, how many distinct sets S are subsets of T?
- 2^n

Question 8
Given a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, what is the probability of being dealt a five card hand where all five cards are of the same suit?  
- 0.001980792316926771

Question 9
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which the entry on one row of the triangle corresponds to the sum of the two entries directly above the entry.  
This program prints out the first few rows of Pascal's triangle.   
- m!/((m-n)!*n!)
